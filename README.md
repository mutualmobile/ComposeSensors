Accessing sensor data of your Android devices just became quick and easy ⚡️

This library provides a convenience wrapper over the [Sensor APIs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview) for Android to be used with Jetpack Compose.

## Demo ❤️

## WIP 🚧
This library is a work-in-progress and is subject to major changes. Our team is working hard to get it stable as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience 🌺

## Usage 🚀
### Install dependency 📲
#### Kotlin `build.gradle.kts (:module-name)`
```
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation("com.mutualmobile:composesensors:x.y.z")
}
```
#### Groovy `build.gradle (:module-name)`
```
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.mutualmobile:composesensors:x.y.z'
}
```

### Snapshots 📸
Add `https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots` as a maven repository resource to be able to access SNAPSHOT versions of this library. Check `tags` for the latest library version.
#### Kotlin `settings.gradle.kts`
```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    ...
    repositories {
        ...
        maven("https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots")
    }
}
```
#### Groovy `settings.gradle`
```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    ...
    repositories {
        ...
        maven {
            url = 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots'
        }
    }
}
```

The library provides straightforward state methods for multiple sensors like Accelerometer, Gyroscope, etc (more mentioned below). Following is an example on how to get the current values from the `Accelerometer`:
```
val accelerometerState = rememberAccelerometerSensorState()
```
Use it in an example:
```
val accelerometerState = rememberAccelerometerSensorState()
// Optional: You could also write: rememberAccelerometerSensorState(sensorDelay = SensorDelay.Fastest) for fetching sensor data faster

Text(
    text = "Force X: ${accelerometerState.xForce}" +
    "\nForce Y: ${accelerometerState.yForce}" +
    "\nForce Z: ${accelerometerState.zForce}" +
    "\nIs Available?: ${accelerometerState.isAvailable}"
)
```
